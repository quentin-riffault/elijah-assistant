Some research on natural language processing. Nothing too revolutionary.

## Introduction
This is a project of mine that I use in order to dive into natural language understanding. 
There is no use of AI in this project. However, some data analysis and data mining principles are used.

In the long term, this could be used as a "dumb" assistant. The goal would be that the user links this assistant
to a speech-to-text algorithm in order to give orders to the model. Moreover, it could be used as a connected
appliance (IoT) controller.
